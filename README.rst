This is a Django admin app for Observation Data Model 2 (ODM2). ODM2
was created through National Science Foundation GrantÂ EAR-1224638.
Support for the development of this application comes
from NSF Grant EAR-1331841 Luquillo CZO.

Django models exist for all ODM2 tables. Forms for ODM2Core and
a number of additional ODM2 tables. Graphing of measurement result
values via highcharts are implemented. Data logger files can be
imported as long as data logger file columns and results are properly
setup.
ODM2 can be found here: https://github.com/ODM2

In the folder templatesAndSettings you will find ``settings.py`` which
contains all of the database and local file system settings which need
to be configured to get a copy of this application working. This was
developed using a postgresql version of ODM2 data model, additional
modifications will be needed to make this work with MSSQL or another
database.

An example postgresqldatabase named ODM2AdminExamplePostgresqlDB, this
is a custom postgresql format backup which can be restored to an empty
database. An extrasql.sql file contains some extra views used for 
efficiently exporting data as emails. 


**Primary Installation**

or

# creates an env with the depepencies
conda create --yes -n ENVNAME python=3.5 --file requirements.txt

# install the dependencies in the current env similar to the pip command above

You will need to run extrasql.sql on a postgreSQL instance of ODM2,
